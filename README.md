# TicTacTriple
The idea for this is to write a tic-tac-toe game through a browser. It's a 3x3x3 game however.

The idea/scope for this is to learn how to:
Draw the project with html/js/canvas
Host the website with Python (probably flask)
Run checks and possibly a bot AI quickly using C++ and FFI
Possibly account storage with SQL

Some design considerations include:
27 spots vs the usual 9
49 completion lines vs the usual 8
